# Quick Start Demo

![Demo Preview](https://picsum.photos/1920/1080)

I believe that you should bring value to the reader as soon as possible. You should be able to get the user up and running with your project with minimal friction.

If you have a quickstart guide, this is where it should be.

Alternatively, you can add a demo to show what your project can do.

# Table of Contents

This is a table of contents for your project. It helps the reader navigate through the README quickly.

- [Project Title](#project-title)
- [Quick Start Demo](#quick-start-demo)
- [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)
- [Contribute](#contribute)
- [License](#license)

# Installation

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

> **Note**: For longer README files, I usually add a "Back to top" buttton as shown above. It makes it easy to navigate.

This is where your installation instructions go.

You can add snippets here that your readers can copy-paste with click:

```shell
gh repo clone navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme
```

# Usage

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Next, you have to explain how to use your project. You can create subsections under here to explain more clearly.
